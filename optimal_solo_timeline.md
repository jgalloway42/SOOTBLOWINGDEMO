# Commercial Demo Timeline
## AI/ML Soot Blowing Optimization - Sales-Focused POC

---

## Executive Summary

**Context**: Building a commercial demo to win client contracts
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks optimal (vs. 2 months constraint)
**Goal**: Compelling sales demo that showcases technical capability and business value
**Philosophy**: "Impressive enough to sell" rather than "perfect enough to deploy"

---

## Commercial Demo Requirements vs. Internal POC

### What Clients Need to See
✅ **Clear value proposition** - "This will save you $X million/year"
✅ **Technical credibility** - "We know what we're doing"
✅ **Visual impact** - "Wow, this looks professional"
✅ **Realistic scenarios** - "This applies to our plant"
✅ **Implementation roadmap** - "Here's how we'd deploy this"

### What Clients DON'T Need to See
❌ Perfect accuracy (75% is fine if it's improving on 0%)
❌ Bulletproof edge case handling
❌ Production-grade error handling
❌ Comprehensive documentation
❌ Academic-level validation

## Commercial Demo vs. Internal POC Differences

### **Demo Focus Areas**
| Component | Internal POC | Commercial Demo |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Accuracy** | >85% validated | >75% believable |
| **Visual Polish** | Functional | Professional/Impressive |
| **Business Case** | Conservative estimates | Optimistic but defendable |
| **Technical Depth** | Full methodology | High-level with details available |
| **Edge Cases** | Comprehensive testing | Handle demo scenarios well |
| **Documentation** | Complete technical docs | Sales materials + overview |

### **Client Psychology**
- **First Impression**: Visual impact and professional appearance
- **Credibility**: Your domain expertise + technical competence
- **Value**: Clear, quantified business benefits

## Commercial Demo Script (30-45 minutes)

### **Opening: Problem & Opportunity (5 minutes)**
- "Most plants clean on fixed schedules - wasteful and inefficient"
- "Our AI optimizes cleaning timing for maximum ROI"
- "Typical results: 20-30% improvement, 18-month payback"

### **Technical Demo: Live System (25 minutes)**
- **Scenario 1**: Normal operations with optimal cleaning timing
- **Scenario 2**: Emergency high fouling response
- **Scenario 3**: Seasonal optimization and coal quality changes
- **ROI Calculator**: Show specific savings for their plant size

### **Implementation Discussion (10 minutes)**
- Technical requirements and integration approach
- Timeline and costs for full deployment
- Support and training services
- Next steps and pilot project proposal

### **Q&A (5 minutes)**
- Technical questions about algorithms
- Business questions about ROI and implementation
- Competitive questions about alternatives

## Risk Management (Commercial Context)

### **Demo Risks**
1. **Technical Failure**: Have backup slides and recorded demo
2. **Unrealistic Expectations**: Be honest about POC limitations
3. **Competitor Response**: Emphasize your unique domain expertise

### **Business Risks**
1. **Over-promising**: Conservative estimates, clear scope boundaries
2. **Under-pricing**: Include contingency in implementation quotes
3. **Technical Debt**: Budget for proper development in client contracts

## Recommended Approach for Your Situation

### **6-8 Weeks is Actually Optimal**
- Faster time to market
- Less internal investment risk
- Quicker feedback from real prospects
- Revenue generation potential

### **Position the 2-Month Timeline**
- "We can have a demo ready in 6-8 weeks"
- "Full implementation would be 4-6 months with client funding"
- "POC showcases our technical approach and business value"

### **Sales Strategy**
1. **Target Early Adopters**: Plants with known fouling issues
2. **Pilot Approach**: Offer discounted pilot implementation
3. **Partnership Model**: Work with boiler OEMs or consulting firms
4. **Value Pricing**: Price based on savings, not cost-plus

This commercial context actually makes the compressed timeline more sensible - you want to get to market quickly with something impressive enough to win contracts, then use client funding to build production-quality systems.
