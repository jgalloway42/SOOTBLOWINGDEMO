## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL FINDINGS: Physics Modeling Issues Identified**

**Comprehensive analysis revealed simulation physics require immediate correction:**

### **High-Priority Issues (2-day fix timeline):**
1. **Load Factor Compliance**: 0.0% within operational range (should be 90%+)
2. **Fouling Physics**: Efficiency increases with fouling (should decrease)  
3. **Time-Based Modeling**: No realistic fouling accumulation over time
4. **Parameter Variations**: 13 constant columns lacking industrial realism

### **Impact Assessment:**
- **ML Model Training**: Current dataset would produce unrealistic models
- **Industrial Deployment**: Physics violations prevent real-world application
- **Business Risk**: Simulation results not aligned with actual boiler behavior
