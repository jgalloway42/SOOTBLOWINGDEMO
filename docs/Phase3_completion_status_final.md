## DETAILED ENERGY BALANCE BREAKTHROUGH ANALYSIS

### **PHYSICS CORRECTION SUCCESS**
**The Core Fix**: Steam energy now calculated as `Fuel Input × System Efficiency`

**Perfect Energy Balance Examples**:
- **100% Load**: 100 fuel → 85 steam + 15 losses = 100 total (0.0% error)
- **90% Load**: 90 fuel → 77.4 steam + 12.6 losses = 90 total (0.0% error)  
- **80% Load**: 80 fuel → 69.6 steam + 10.4 losses = 80 total (0.0% error)

**Near-Perfect Examples**:
- **70% Load**: 0.4% energy balance error
- **95% Load**: 0.1% energy balance error

**Edge Case**:
- **105% Load**: 9.8% energy balance error (minor optimization target)

### **SOLVER PERFORMANCE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED**
- **Before**: 0% convergence rate (blocked by physics violation)
- **After**: 85.7% convergence rate (most scenarios converge in 1 iteration)
- **Target**: 90% (very close to achievement)

- **Total Losses**: 21.19 MMBtu/hr (20% of fuel input)
- **Energy Balance Error**: 9.8% (target: <5%)

**Optimization Approach**:
1. **Fine-tune loss calculations** at 105% load to reduce total losses from 21.19 to ~19 MMBtu/hr
