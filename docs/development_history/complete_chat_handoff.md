            print(">>> API COMPATIBILITY ISSUES STILL PRESENT")
            print(">>> Review error messages and fix remaining issues")
            print(">>> Check logs/simulation/ for detailed error information")
            print("="*60)
            logger.error("API compatibility validation failed")
            sys.exit(1)
            
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n[CRITICAL ERROR] Main execution failed: {e}")
        print("Error details:")
        traceback.print_exc()
        logger.error(f"Main execution failed: {e}")

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **If File Fix Fails:**
1. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure you can edit `annual_boiler_simulator.py`
2. **Verify File Integrity**: File should end with the `test_fixed_interface()` function
3. **Add Import**: May need `import sys` at top if not already present
4. **Check Indentation**: Use spaces, not tabs, matching existing code style

### **If Validation Tests Fail:**
1. **Working Directory**: Must be in `src/models/complete_boiler_simulation/`
2. **Dependencies**: Run `pip install iapws pandas numpy matplotlib scipy`
3. **Import Paths**: Verify all module files are present in correct directories
4. **Log Files**: Check `logs/simulation/annual_simulation.log` for detailed errors

### **If Simulations Fail:**
1. **Memory**: Large simulations may need 8GB+ RAM available
2. **Solver Settings**: Use relaxed tolerance (`tolerance=20.0`) for initial testing
3. **Disk Space**: Ensure 500MB+ available for dataset generation
4. **Permissions**: Check write permissions for `data/`, `logs/`, `outputs/` directories
