Perfect! I've completed the enhanced boiler system code with comprehensive coal combustion integration and ML dataset generation for soot blowing optimization. Here's what this complete system provides:
ðŸ”¥ **Key Features Implemented:**
--------------------------------

### **1. Coal Combustion Integration**

* **CoalCombustionModel**: Simplified but functional combustion analysis
* **SootProductionModel**: Links combustion conditions to soot formation
* **CombustionFoulingIntegrator**: Connects soot production to fouling buildup

### **2. Advanced Fouling Simulation**

* **Individual segment fouling control** for precise soot blowing simulation
* **Progressive fouling buildup** over time based on operating conditions
* **Section-specific fouling factors** based on local temperature and velocity
* **Custom fouling arrays** for testing different cleaning scenarios

### **3. ML Dataset Generation**

* **MLDatasetGenerator**: Creates comprehensive datasets with 50,000+ scenarios
* **Multi-objective targets**: Efficiency gain, cleaning cost, payback time, ROI
* **Rich feature engineering**: Operating conditions, coal properties, fouling state
* **Realistic cleaning strategies**: From "clean all" to selective segment cleaning

### **4. Soot Blowing Optimization**

* **SootBlowingSimulator**: Models cleaning effectiveness on individual segments
* **Economic modeling**: Cleaning costs vs fuel savings analysis
* **Performance tracking**: Before/after efficiency and temperature changes
* **Strategic cleaning**: Different approaches (worst-first, economizer-priority, etc.)

ðŸ¤– **ML Training Approach:**
----------------------------

The system generates datasets perfect for training models that can:

1. **Predict fouling buildup** based on combustion conditions
2. **Optimize cleaning timing** for maximum ROI
3. **Recommend cleaning strategies** (which segments, when, how much)
4. **Forecast performance impacts** of different operating scenarios

ðŸ“Š **Dataset Features Generated:**
----------------------------------

**Input Features (45+):**

* Coal properties (carbon, volatile matter, ash, sulfur)
* Operating conditions (load, air flow, temperature, humidity)
* Combustion results (NOx, O2, efficiency, flame temperature)
* Current fouling state (statistical summaries per section)
* Cleaning strategy parameters
* Seasonal and operational context

**Target Variables (8):**

* Efficiency gain from cleaning
* Heat transfer improvement
* Fuel savings rate ($/hr)
* Cleaning cost and time
* Payback period
* 24-hour ROI
* Overall performance score

ðŸŽ¯ **How to Use for ML Training:**
----------------------------------

1. **Generate Large Dataset**: Run with `num_scenarios=50000` for robust training
2. **Feature Selection**: Use combustion and fouling features for prediction
3. **Multi-target Models**: Train on efficiency gain, cost, and timing simultaneously
4. **Time Series**: LSTM models for fouling progression prediction
5. **Reinforcement Learning**: Use for real-time soot blowing decisions

The system is now ready to generate the datasets you need to train ML models for intelligent soot blowing optimization! The code includes comprehensive examples, validation, and visualization capabilities.
