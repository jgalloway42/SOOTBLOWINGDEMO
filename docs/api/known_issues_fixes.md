## TROUBLESHOOTING WEEK 2 ISSUES

### Issue: File Corruption - Missing Main Section
```
python simulation/annual_boiler_simulator.py
# No output or immediate exit
```

**Solution:** Add the main execution section provided in this documentation
```python
# Add the complete if __name__ == "__main__": block to end of file
```

### Issue: Import Errors After File Updates
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core.boiler_system'
```

**Solution:** Verify working directory and imports
```bash
cd src/models/complete_boiler_simulation
python -c "import core.boiler_system; print('OK')"
```

### Issue: Solver Non-Convergence
```
Converged: False, Energy Balance Error: 25.3%
```

**Solution:** Use relaxed solver settings for testing
```python
results = boiler.solve_enhanced_system(
    max_iterations=25,     # More iterations
    tolerance=20.0         # Relaxed tolerance
)
```

### Issue: Missing Dependencies
```
ImportError: No module named 'iapws'
```

**Solution:** Install required dependencies
```bash
pip install iapws pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### Issue: File Permission Errors
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```

**Solution:** Ensure proper directory permissions
```bash
chmod 755 logs/ data/ outputs/
mkdir -p logs/debug logs/simulation data/generated/annual_datasets outputs/metadata
```

## ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Soot Blowing Analysis Logic Errors + Simulation Issue

### Issue Description  
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Analysis fixed, simulation issue identified  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-03 during notebook 2.5 analysis  
**Impact**: High - Simulation doesn't actually apply cleaning effects to fouling data  

**UPDATE**: Analysis logic fixes were successful and work correctly. However, testing revealed the real root cause: the simulation generates cleaning events but doesn't actually reduce fouling factors when cleaning occurs.

### Root Cause Analysis

**INCORRECT Initial Assessment**:
~~Individual tube/section-specific soot blowing indicators missing~~ ❌

**✅ ANALYSIS ISSUES FIXED**:
1. **Column Name Mismatch**: ✅ Fixed - Analysis now uses correct `[section]_cleaning` pattern
2. **Wrong Time Windows**: ✅ Fixed - Changed from 24-hour to 2-hour analysis windows  
3. **Measurement Sensitivity**: ✅ Addressed - Analysis now properly handles small fouling spans

**❌ REAL ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED**:
**Simulation doesn't actually reduce fouling factors during cleaning events**
- Cleaning flags are set correctly (`furnace_walls_cleaning = True`)
- Fouling factors continue building up linearly (1.000 → 1.250) regardless of cleaning
- `_apply_soot_blowing_effects()` function doesn't modify fouling factor data

### Confirmed Dataset Structure (CORRECT)

**Actual Soot Blowing Columns (16 total)**:
- `soot_blowing_active` - Global cleaning indicator
- `furnace_walls_cleaning` - Furnace section cleaning
- `generating_bank_cleaning` - Generating bank cleaning
- `superheater_primary_cleaning` - Primary superheater cleaning
- `superheater_secondary_cleaning` - Secondary superheater cleaning
- `economizer_primary_cleaning` - Primary economizer cleaning
- `economizer_secondary_cleaning` - Secondary economizer cleaning  
- `air_heater_cleaning` - Air heater cleaning
- Plus 8 additional cleaning tracking columns (hours since last cleaning, effectiveness metrics)

**Fouling Monitoring (49+ columns)**:
- Section-specific fouling factors for all major boiler components
- Segment-level fouling tracking within each section
- Heat transfer impact measurements

### Impact Analysis (CORRECTED)

**Cleaning Effectiveness Analysis**:
- Previous results: 0.0-0.1% effectiveness (due to analysis errors)
- Expected results: 80-95% fouling reduction (per simulation physics)
- **Resolution**: Updated analysis to use correct column names and time windows

**Commercial Deployment**:
- Dataset structure supports full optimization analysis
- Section-specific cleaning data available for targeted recommendations
- Real-world applicability confirmed with proper analysis methods

### Validation Test Results (2025-09-03)

**Analysis Testing Results**:
- ✅ **Column Detection**: Found 9 cleaning columns (furnace_walls_cleaning, generating_bank_cleaning, etc.)
- ✅ **Event Detection**: Found 121 furnace cleaning events (1.4% frequency)
- ❌ **Effectiveness Measurement**: **0.1% average effectiveness detected**

**Detailed Investigation Results**:
```
Furnace fouling factor range: 1.000000 to 1.250000 (span: 0.250000)
Cleaning events analyzed: 20 events
Significant reductions (>5%): 0 events  
Average reduction: 0.2%
Expected reduction if 80% effective: 0.200 fouling units
Actual reduction observed: ~0.001 fouling units
```

**Conclusion**: Analysis logic works correctly but simulation doesn't implement cleaning effects.

### Resolution Applied

**✅ ANALYSIS FIXES COMPLETED**:
1. **Column Mapping Fixed**: Updated analysis to use `[section]_cleaning` column pattern
2. **Time Windows Corrected**: Changed from 24-hour to 1-2 hour analysis windows  
3. **Section Correlation**: Proper mapping between cleaning columns and fouling factor columns
4. **Documentation Updated**: Fixed model references and metadata links

**❌ SIMULATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
- `annual_boiler_simulator.py` - `_apply_soot_blowing_effects()` doesn't modify fouling factors
- `_generate_fouling_data()` - May need to respect cleaning resets  
- **Next Step**: Fix simulation to actually reduce fouling when cleaning occurs

**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `notebooks/2.5-jdg-boiler-fouling-dataset-physics-corrected-sim-eda.ipynb`
- ✅ `src/models/complete_boiler_simulation/analysis/boiler_eda_analysis.py`
- ✅ `docs/CLAUDE.md`

### Current Status
**Priority**: 🚨 HIGH - Core simulation functionality missing  
**Timeline**: Analysis corrections completed, simulation fix needed  
**Effort**: Medium - Requires simulation logic modification and dataset regeneration  
**Risk**: Medium - May require breaking changes to simulation output format
