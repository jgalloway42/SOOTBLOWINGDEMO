No, there are likely **several other files** that need updates for the enhanced IAPWS integration. Let me identify all the potential compatibility issues:

## **Files That Likely Need Updates:**

### **1. `data_analysis_tools.py` (Confirmed Issue)**
- **Problem**: Expects old boiler system interface
- **Needs**: Update to work with enhanced SystemPerformance dataclass and IAPWS properties

### **2. `heat_transfer_calculations.py`**
- **Problem**: Enhanced boiler system imports this, but it may not be compatible with new interfaces
- **Potential Issues**: Method signatures, property access patterns, enhanced section configurations

### **3. `fouling_and_soot_blowing.py`** 
- **Problem**: Enhanced system uses this for section management and soot blowing
- **Potential Issues**: Section initialization, fouling factor management, soot blowing effectiveness calculations

### **4. `coal_combustion_models.py`**
- **Problem**: Annual simulator imports `CoalCombustionModel` and `CombustionFoulingIntegrator`
- **Potential Issues**: Interface changes, data structure expectations, integration with enhanced boiler system

## **Other Potential Compatibility Issues:**

### **5. Any Analysis Scripts or Notebooks**
- Scripts that import and use the boiler system
- Jupyter notebooks with old system interfaces
- Test scripts that validate system performance

### **6. Configuration Files**
- Any config files that specify old class names or module paths
- Settings files that reference old data structures

### **7. Utility Scripts**
- Data processing scripts that expect old CSV column names
- Validation scripts that check old performance metrics
- Plotting scripts that use old data formats

## **The Import Chain Problem:**

When you run `run_annual_simulation.py`, it tries to import:
```python
from annual_boiler_simulator import AnnualBoilerSimulator  # ✓ Updated
```

But `annual_boiler_simulator.py` imports:
```python
from boiler_system import EnhancedCompleteBoilerSystem     # ✓ Updated  
from coal_combustion_models import CoalCombustionModel     # ? May need update
from thermodynamic_properties import PropertyCalculator   # ✓ Updated
```

And `boiler_system.py` imports:
```python
from heat_transfer_calculations import HeatTransferCalculator  # ? May need update
from fouling_and_soot_blowing import BoilerSection           # ? May need update
```

If **any** of these downstream modules have incompatible interfaces, the whole import chain fails.

## **Most Likely Culprits (in order of probability):**

### **1. `data_analysis_tools.py`** (90% probability)
- Directly imported by runner script
- Most likely to have interface incompatibilities

### **2. `heat_transfer_calculations.py`** (60% probability)  
- Used by enhanced boiler system
- May expect different method signatures or data structures

### **3. `fouling_and_soot_blowing.py`** (50% probability)
- Used for section management in enhanced system
- May have initialization or interface changes

### **4. `coal_combustion_models.py`** (30% probability)
- Used by annual simulator
- Likely more stable but could have integration issues

## **Quick Diagnostic:**

To identify exactly which file is causing the import failure, you could temporarily comment out imports in `run_annual_simulation.py` one by one:

1. Comment out `from data_analysis_tools import BoilerDataAnalyzer`
2. If that fixes it, the issue is confirmed to be `data_analysis_tools.py`
3. If not, the issue is in the import chain of the enhanced modules

## **The Reality:**

The enhanced modules I provided assume that the **base modules** they import are compatible with the new interfaces. If the original codebase has evolved or has different method signatures, there could be multiple compatibility issues.

**Most likely**: `data_analysis_tools.py` is the primary issue, but there may be 1-2 other files that need minor updates for full compatibility.

Would you like me to help identify the exact import failure, or should I update the most likely problem files?
