### ANNUAL DATASET GENERATION
**Target**: Complete 8760-hour dataset for ML training
**File Location**: `data/generated/annual_datasets/`
**Validation**: Check file size >10MB with realistic data ranges

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDELINES

### IF INTEGRATION ERRORS OCCUR:
1. **Import Errors**: Check all modules are in the project directory
2. **Method Missing**: Verify all required methods exist in updated files
3. **Parameter Errors**: Check method signatures match between files

### IF ENERGY BALANCE ERRORS PERSIST:
1. **Check 105% Load**: Should show ~3-4% error (down from 9.8%)
2. **Check Other Loads**: Should maintain <1% errors for 60-100% loads
3. **Review Logs**: Check `logs/debug/` for detailed error analysis

### IF ANNUAL SIMULATION FAILS:
1. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure `iapws` library installed (`pip install iapws`)
2. **Check File Structure**: Verify directory creation in logs/
3. **Check Integration**: Run `python boiler_system.py` first to validate core system
